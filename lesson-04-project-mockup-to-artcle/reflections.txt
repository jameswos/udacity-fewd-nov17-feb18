You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

  * I have learned the beginnings of the process a web developer goes through to create a website.
  * I have also learned basic html tags to make different elements and the proper syntax to use when writing said code!
  * Additionally, I have learned how to research and work my way through problems using atom and chrome to save and check my progress as I work through problems.
  * I find html pretty straight forward now that I've completed a few lessons, but I wouldn't go as far to say it's easy.
  * Nothing has been overly difficult as I like to solve problems and work through things by researching and finding my own way through things. It's been very enjoyable. Although, I think my screen size limits my ability to switch between the mock up picture, my text editor and the website though. I might need to invest in a multi-monitor set up!
